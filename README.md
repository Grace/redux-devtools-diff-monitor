# Redux DevTools – Diff Monitor
This project provides an alternate monitor to Redux DevTools – the primary concern for this monitor is easily showing the mutation of your application's state from action to action, while still providing the same level of control afforded by the default DevTools monitor (rollback, commit, reset and individual action toggles).
